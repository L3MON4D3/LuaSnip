# Features
- Tabstops
- Text-Transformations using Lua functions
- Conditional Expansion
- Defining nested Snippets
- Filetype-specific Snippets
- Choices
- Dynamic Snippet creation
- Regex-Trigger
- Autotriggered Snippets
- Easy Postfix Snippets
- Fast
- Parse [LSP-Style](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification#snippet_syntax) Snippets either directly in lua, as a vscode package or a snipmate snippet collection.
- Expand LSP-Snippets with [nvim-compe](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-compe) (or its' successor, [nvim-cmp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp) (requires [cmp_luasnip](https://github.com/saadparwaiz1/cmp_luasnip)))
- Snippet history (jump back into older snippets)
- Resolve filetype at the cursor using Treesitter

# Drawbacks
- Snippets that make use of the entire functionality of this plugin have to be defined in Lua (but 95% of snippets can be written in lsp-syntax).

# Requirements
Neovim >= 0.5 (extmarks)
`jsregexp` for lsp-snippet-transformations (see [here](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip/blob/master/DOC.md#transformations) for some tips on installing it).

# Setup
## Install 
* With your preferred plugin manager i.e. [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), [Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) or [lazy](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)  
  **Packer**:
  ```lua
  use({
  	"L3MON4D3/LuaSnip",
  	-- follow latest release.
  	tag = "v<CurrentMajor>.*",
  	-- install jsregexp (optional!:).
  	run = "make install_jsregexp"
  })
  ```
  **lazy**:
  ```lua
  {
  	"L3MON4D3/LuaSnip",
  	-- follow latest release.
  	version = "<CurrentMajor>.*",
  	-- install jsregexp (optional!).
  	build = "make install_jsregexp"
  }
  ```
  **vim-plug**:
  ```vim
  " follow latest release and install jsregexp.
  Plug 'L3MON4D3/LuaSnip', {'tag': 'v<CurrentMajor>.*', 'do': 'make install_jsregexp'}
  ```
  Check the `Releases`-section to the right for the latest major version.

* LuaSnip uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) (with some leeway, big patches might end up as a Minor version)!  
  Releases will be tagged as `vMajor.Minor.Patch`, we recommend following the latest Major release.  
  Consider watching the repos releases so you're notified when a new version becomes available.

## Keymaps
```vim
" press <Tab> to expand or jump in a snippet. These can also be mapped separately
" via <Plug>luasnip-expand-snippet and <Plug>luasnip-jump-next.
imap <silent><expr> <Tab> luasnip#expand_or_jumpable() ? '<Plug>luasnip-expand-or-jump' : '<Tab>' 
" -1 for jumping backwards.
inoremap <silent> <S-Tab> <cmd>lua require'luasnip'.jump(-1)<Cr>

snoremap <silent> <Tab> <cmd>lua require('luasnip').jump(1)<Cr>
snoremap <silent> <S-Tab> <cmd>lua require('luasnip').jump(-1)<Cr>

" For changing choices in choiceNodes (not strictly necessary for a basic setup).
imap <silent><expr> <C-E> luasnip#choice_active() ? '<Plug>luasnip-next-choice' : '<C-E>'
smap <silent><expr> <C-E> luasnip#choice_active() ? '<Plug>luasnip-next-choice' : '<C-E>'
```
`nvim-cmp`'s wiki also contains [an example](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp/wiki/Example-mappings#luasnip) for
setting up a super-tab-like mapping.

## Add Snippets

Check out [the doc](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip/blob/master/DOC.md#loaders) for a general explanation of the
loaders and their benefits. The following list serves only as a short overview.

- **VS Code-like**: To use existing VS Code style snippets from a plugin (eg. [rafamadriz/friendly-snippets](https://github.com/rafamadriz/friendly-snippets)) simply install the plugin and then add
    ```lua
    require("luasnip.loaders.from_vscode").lazy_load()
    ```
	somewhere in your nvim-config. LuaSnip will then load the snippets contained in the plugin on startup.
  You can also easily **load your own custom vscode style snippets** by passing the path to the custom snippet-directory to the load function:
    ```lua
    -- load snippets from path/of/your/nvim/config/my-cool-snippets
    require("luasnip.loaders.from_vscode").lazy_load({ paths = { "./my-cool-snippets" } })
    ```
	For more info on the VS Code loader, check the [examples](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip/blob/b5a72f1fbde545be101fcd10b70bcd51ea4367de/Examples/snippets.lua#L501) or [documentation](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip/blob/master/DOC.md#loaders).

- **SnipMate-like**: Very similar to VS Code packages; install a plugin that provides snippets and call the `load`-function:
    ```lua
    require("luasnip.loaders.from_snipmate").lazy_load()
    ```
    The SnipMate format is very simple, so adding **custom snippets** only requires a few steps:
    - add a directory beside your `init.vim` (or any other place that is in your `runtimepath`) named `snippets`.
    - inside that directory, create files named `<filetype>.snippets` and add snippets for the given filetype in it (for inspiration, check [honza/vim-snippets](https://github.com/honza/vim-snippets/tree/master/snippets)).  
        ``` snipmate
        # comment
        snippet <trigger> <description>
        <snippet-body>
        snippet if C-style if
        if ($1)
        	$0
        ```
    Again, there are some [examples](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip/blob/b5a72f1fbde545be101fcd10b70bcd51ea4367de/Examples/snippets.lua#L517) and [documentation](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip/blob/master/DOC.md#snipmate).  
- **Lua**: Add the snippets by calling `require("luasnip").add_snippets(filetype, snippets)`. An example for this can be found [here](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip/blob/master/Examples/snippets.lua#L190).  
This can also be done much cleaner, with all the benefits that come with using a loader, by using the [loader for lua](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip/blob/master/DOC.md#lua)

There's also a repository collecting snippets for various languages, [molleweide/LuaSnip-snippets.nvim](https://github.com/molleweide/LuaSnip-snippets.nvim)

## Documentation

### Getting started

You have two main choices: use SnipMate/VS Code snippets (easier) or write snippets in Lua (more complex but also more feature-rich).
Here are some suggestions for getting started in either case:

* **SnipMate or VS Code snippets**: if you only want to write/load SnipMate or VS Code snippets and ignore Lua snippets (and this is definitely recommended if you don't yet need Lua snippets' more complicated features), check out the sections on loading [VS Code](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip/blob/master/DOC.md#vscode) or [SnipMate](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip/blob/master/DOC.md#snipmate) packages in `DOC.md`.
  Of those two, SnipMate is definitely the more comfortable way of writing snippets.
* **Lua snippets**: we suggest first watching or reading one of the introductory guides in the [Resources for new users](#resources-for-new-users) section below.
  After getting familiar with the basics, you should check out the important LuaSnip features in the following list:
  * [`config`](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip/blob/master/DOC.md#config-reference): Notable: `region_check_events` for jumping to the end of snippets the cursor is no longer inside of,
    `delete_check_events` for cleaning up snippets whose text was deleted,
    and `enable_autosnippets` to enable automatic snippet expansion.
  * [`extras`](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip/blob/master/DOC.md#extras): This module contains many functions that make writing snippets
    significantly easier;
    `fmt` and `lambda` are especially useful.
  * [`lua-loader`](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip/blob/master/DOC.md#lua):
    A very useful way to load snippets, more comfortable than calling `add_snippets`.  
    Also supports hot reload (limited to buffers in the same NeoVim instance as the edited file) and [jumping to the files that provide snippets to the
    current buffer](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip/blob/master/DOC.md#edit_snippets).
  * Advanced nodes:
    [`functionNode`](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip/blob/master/DOC.md#functionnode),
    [`dynamicNode`](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip/blob/master/DOC.md#functionnode),
    [`choiceNode`](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip/blob/master/DOC.md#choicenode) and [`restoreNode`](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip/blob/master/DOC.md#restorenode).  
    Instead of reading about them in the doc, the first three are explained very
    well in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtQZRAkgLqo) by TJ
    DeVries.

### Official docs and examples

Note: instead of immediately reading the official documentation, you may want to check out the [Resources for new users](#resources-for-new-users) section below since the docs are written more as a reference manual than as a tutorial for new users.

- [`DOC.md`](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip/blob/master/DOC.md) is the main documentation—it gives an overview of how to write snippets, explains the role and use case of each LuaSnip node, shows how to load snippets from Lua, VS Code, and SnipMate formats, and covers the available LuaSnip API.
- `:help luasnip.txt` is a plain text version of `DOC.md` available with Neovim's `:help` feature.
- The file [`Examples/snippets.lua`](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip/blob/master/Examples/snippets.lua) contains many example snippets written in Lua—we highly recommend looking through (or better yet, `:luafile`ing) these example snippets before using LuaSnip's advanced features.
- The [Wiki](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip/wiki) contains some useful LuaSnip extensions and some examples of advanced snippets and configs.
- Configuration is documented [in `DOC.md`](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip/blob/master/DOC.md#config-reference) as well.

【中文版】DOC in Chinese is [here](https://zjp-cn.github.io/neovim0.6-blogs/nvim/luasnip/doc1.html). 

### Resources for new users
Here are some LuaSnip videos and tutorials on the Web:
- [Introductory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn800rlPIho) and [advanced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtQZRAkgLqo) YouTube videos by the one and only [TJ DeVries](https://github.com/tjdevries). Unfortunately there were some breaking changes in LuaSnip since these videos were recorded:
  * Snippets are now added via [`ls.add_snippets`](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip/blob/master/DOC.md#adding-snippets) instead of with `ls.snippets = {}`
- A [guide to writing snippets in Lua](https://www.ejmastnak.com/tutorials/vim-latex/luasnip.html) with LaTeX-themed GIFs and real-life examples by [@ejmastnak](https://github.com/ejmastnak)
- A [collection of LuaSnip guides](https://evesdropper.dev/files/luasnip) by [@evesdropper](https://github.com/evesdropper), with most of them also in a LaTeX context
- An introductory LuaSnip [video tutorial for beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub0REXjhpmk) by Ziontee113
