-- insert operations into typeahead buffer in a controlled manner.
-- We want to follow these guidelines:
-- * maintain order of luasnip-operations. Example:
--   `ls.jump() ls.jump()`, the first jump is completely executed, and only
--   then the second jump is.
-- * insert our operations before other typeahead.
--   This is to behave correctly in a macro: IIUC the complete macro is written
--   into typeahead, so if our operations are appended, we will jump way later
--   than in the actual recorded "session", and input won't end up where it
--   belongs.
--
-- We will achieve these goals by only ever having one operation in the
-- typeahead, and once it is finished it calls a callback that will insert any
-- other keys that were requested to be executed.
--
-- This scheme is inspired by @hrsh7th's work in nvim-cmp.
