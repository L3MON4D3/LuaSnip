-- EDGE(/side) of `pos` is inside.
-- This convention is chosen since a snippet inserted at `pos` will move the
-- character at `pos` to the right.
-- The exact meaning of "inside" can be influenced with `respect_rgravs` and
-- `boundary_resolve_mode`:
-- * if `respect_rgravs` is true, "inside" emulates the shifting-behaviour of
--   extmarks:
--   First of all, we compare the left edge of `pos` with the left/right edges
--   of from/to, depending on rgrav.
--   If the left edge is <= left/right edge of from, and < left/right edge of
--   to, `pos` is inside the node.
--
-- * if `respect_rgravs` is false, pos has to be fully inside a node to be
--   considered inside it. If pos is on the left endpoint, it is considered to be
--   left of the node, and likewise for the right endpoint.
--
-- * `boundary_resolve_mode` changes how a position on the boundary of a node
-- is treated:
-- * for `"prefer_linkable/interactive"`, we assume that the nodes in `nodes` are
-- contiguous, and prefer falling into the previous/next node if `pos` is on
-- mid's boundary, and mid is not linkable/interactie.
-- This way, we are more likely to return a node that can handle a new
-- snippet/is interactive.
-- * `"prefer_outside"` makes sense when the nodes are not contiguous, and we'd
-- like to find a position between two nodes.
-- This mode makes sense for finding the snippet a new snippet should be
-- inserted in, since we'd like to prefer inserting before/after a snippet, if
-- the position is ambiguous.
--
-- In general:
-- These options are useful for making this function more general: When
-- searching in the contiguous nodes of a snippet, we'd like this routine to
-- return any of them (obviously the one pos is inside/or on the border of, and
-- we'd like to prefer returning a node that can be linked), but in no case
-- fail.
-- However! when searching the top-level snippets with the intention of finding
-- the snippet/node a new snippet should be expanded inside, it seems better to
-- shift an existing snippet to the right/left than expand the new snippet
-- inside it (when the expand-point is on the boundary).
